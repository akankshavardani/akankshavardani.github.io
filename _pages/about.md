I am an Economics PhD candidate at Columbia University.  

I will be a [NBER Gender in the Economy Fellow](https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/gender-economy/gender-economy-fellows) for academic year 2023-2024. I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from Delhi University in 2013 and my master’s degree in Economics from Delhi School of Economics in 2018. 

My primary areas of research are Development Economics, Public Economics, and Economics of the Family and Gender.
