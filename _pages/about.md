excerpt: "Fifth year Economics PhD Student"
---

Hello ! I am an Economics PhD candidate at Columbia University.

My primary areas of research are Development Economics, Public Economics, and Economics of Family and Gender. I was a NBER Gender in the Economy Fellow for 2023-2024.  

Before Columbia, I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics from Delhi University in 2016 and my master’s degree in Economics from Delhi School of Economics in 2018. 

I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market. In my job market paper, I study the effect of improving women's property rights on their empowerment outcomes. I conduct a field experiment in India in collaboration with the local government and an NGO working on gender issues. For more details on the paper please refer to the <a href="https://akankshavardani.github.io/research/">Research</a> page.
