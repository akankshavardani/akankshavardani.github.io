		  <summary>Short abstract</summary>
			We propose a MFG model for the evolution of residents and firms densities, coupled both by labour market equilibrium conditions and competition for land use; the former induces a new optimal transport coupling in the system of two HJB and two Fokker-Planck equations. This MFG has a convex potential which enables us to find weak solutions by a variational  approach. In the case of quadratic Hamiltonians, we reformulate the problem in Lagrangian terms and develop a numerical solution method.
