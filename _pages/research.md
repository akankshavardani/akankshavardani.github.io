	<details>
		  <summary>Short abstract</summary>
			Even if pure instability does not generate any short term expected gains, players with opposed interests can leverage it to obtain long term changes. In equilibrium, the least favored player uses instability in a decreasing manner as we get closer to a stable state; long run outcome exhibit path dependency and can sustain high inequity.

	<details>
		  <summary>Short abstract</summary>
			We propose a MFG model for the evolution of residents and firms densities, coupled both by labour market equilibrium conditions and competition for land use; the former induces a new optimal transport coupling in the system of two HJB and two Fokker-Planck equations. This MFG has a convex potential which enables us to find weak solutions by a variational  approach. In the case of quadratic Hamiltonians, we reformulate the problem in Lagrangian terms and develop a numerical solution method.
